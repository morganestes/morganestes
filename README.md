### Hi there 👋
I'm software developer (PHP, JS, CSS, bash, and WordPress are my bread and butter), but love to try new languages and ideas to create solutions for problems I encounter. I've dabbled in Python, Ruby, Perl, shell scripting, C++, C#, VB.NET, and a few others, but PHP is my go-to language.

When I'm not writing code, I spend time with my family or on my ham radio ([W3PHP](https://www.qrz.com/db/W3PHP) is my call sign cuz I'm nerdy like that).

- 🔭 I'm currently working on WordPress products and internal tools for [LocaliQ](https://localiq.com).
- 💬 Ask me about [WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org) and I'll try to help.
