### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm mainly a web developer (PHP, JS, CSS, and WordPress are my bread and butter), but love to try new languages and ideas to create solutions for problems I encounter. I've dabbled in Python, Ruby, Perl, shell scripting, C++, C#, VB.NET, and a few others, but PHP is my go-to language.

When I'm not writing code, I spend time with my family or on my ham radio ([W3PHP](https://www.qrz.com/db/W3PHP) is my call sign cuz I'm nerdy like that).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on multiple WordPress products for [LOCALiQ](https://localiq.com).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about [WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org) and I'll try to help.
